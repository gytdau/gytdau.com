					It all started when we realised that nothing out there offered a full, interactive and modern
					learning experience for secondary school students.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was a problem: particularly, many schools were now beginning to enact a 'one tablet per child'
					policy. It's the perfect opportunity for a fully fledged learning system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our idea was a collection of interactive questions and tests that gave you real-time feedback on
					your progress - all organised into subject, year, and level.
				</p>
				<p>
					This way, you'd have the benefit of flashcards and spaced revision, without having to create any of
					the content yourself.

					The puzzle mode below was designed to give more hands-on practice to writing essay-style answers,
					which are an important part of the state examinations.

					The project was built on Ruby on Rails and SASS, and was hosted on a Digital Ocean VPS which I
					managed.

				<p>When we were exhibiting at a science fair, Jack Manning approached us and persuaded us not to archive the project but instead continue work and be a part of the ExamLearn team.</p>
				<p>We helped ExamLearn transition from a Wordpress-based system to our Ruby on Rails setup, and are still working with them to this day, adding features and maintaining functionality.</p>
				<h3 id="Technical-details">Technical details</h3>
				<p>Like our previous projects in the past, we were most comfortable with Rails as a backend and React.js on the front end. This setup proved to be scalable to our needs of handling ~75 thousand yearly impressions and we have full confidence that it can continue to scale as ExamLearn grows.</p>
